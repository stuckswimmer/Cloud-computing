CSMCC16 Cloud Computing Coursework

Objectives

•	Determine the number of flights from each airport; include a list of any airports not used.

•	Create a list of flights based on the Flight id, this output should include the passenger Id, relevant IATA/FAA codes, the departure time, the arrival time (times to be converted to HH:MM:SS format), and the flight times.

•	Calculate the number of passengers on each flight.
•	Calculate the line-of-sight (nautical) miles for each flight and the total travelled by each passenger and thus output the passenger having earned the highest air miles.



Tasks

1.	For this task in the development process, develop a non-MapReduce executable prototype, (in Java, C, or C++). The objective is to develop the basic functional ‘building-blocks’ that will support the development objectives listed above, in a way that mimics something of the operation of the MapReduce/Hadoop framework. 

2.	The solution may use multi-threading if this suits your particular design and implementation strategy, the marking strategy will reflect the appropriate use of: coding techniques, succinct standard or Javadoc comments (only where really needed), data structures and overall program design. The code should be subject to command line version control using a Subversion repository under your university username

3.	The final results/output must use the AComp_Passenger_data.csv file. Error detection and handling for this task can be quite basic, but it must be robust and follow a logical, well considered strategy – the latter is entirely for you to decide

4.	Write a brief report (no more than 7 pages for the actual content, not including title page) explaining:

a)	The high-level description of the development of the prototype software.
b)	A simple description of the Subversion command line process undertaken.
c)	A detailed description of the MapReduce functions you are replicating.
d)	The output format of any reports that each job produces.
e)	The strategy derived to handle input data error detection/correction and/or run-time recovery.
f)	A self-appraisal of your (equivalent) MapReduce run-time software, with suggestions as to how it may be usefully improved upon. You may comment on any aspect of the development process.
